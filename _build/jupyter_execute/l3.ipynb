    "## Overview description of the GHRSST L3 data product\n",
    "\n",
    "GHRSST L3 data have been introduced to provide users with gridded, synthetic,\n",
    "and potentially adjusted SST products, bringing added value with respect to the\n",
    "original L2P but still allowing traceability to the original dataset. GHRSST L3\n",
    "products do not use analysis or interpolation procedure to fill gaps where no\n",
    "observations are available. The GHRSST L3 products include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Un-collated** data that represent a straightforward remapping of L2P GHRSST\n",
    "  data granules to a space grid without combining any observations from\n",
    "  overlapping orbits or times. Although in principle these data may or may not\n",
    "  be adjusted to a reference sensor, in practice the un-collated L3 will\n",
    "  normally be a remapped L2P dataset. For remapping best practices of L2P on \n",
    "  a  grid, see {numref}`l2_remapping_best_practice`.\n",
    "- **Collated** data that grid observations from a single instrument and a single\n",
    "  platform into space and/or time bins. These data may or may not be adjusted to\n",
    "  a reference sensor. For collating best practices, see \n",
    "  {numref}`collating_best_practice` and for adjustment best practices see\n",
    "  {numref}`adjustment_best_practice`.\n",
    "- **Super-collated** data that combine observations from a multiple instruments\n",
    "  into a space-time grid. In this case, the adjustment to a common reference is\n",
    "  necessary to avoid heterogeneities in the resulting field. For best practices\n",
    "  concerning the creation of super collated files see\n",
    "  {numref}`supercollating_best_practice`\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, the format of a L3 file will be able to cope with the three kinds\n",
    "of L3 SST presented above. The L3 format will include the following parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **In case the L3 is un-adjusted**, a mandatory section containing the \n",
    "   original L2P information remapped onto the grid point: the original sea \n",
    "   surface temperature, quality level and SSES information. An optional \n",
    "   section including the remapping condition information may also be \n",
    "   provided. These files are essentially gridded L2P files.\n",
    "2. **In case the L3 is adjusted to a reference**, the adjusted SST value must \n",
    "   be provided, together with the local bias to the reference, the error \n",
    "   generated by the adjustment processing, and the overall error resulting \n",
    "   from the combination of the SSES and the adjustment processing error.\n",
    "3. **In case the L3 is super-collated**, the source of SST at each pixel is \n",
    "   mandatory.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Un-adjusted files**: In the case of **un-collated or collated un-adjusted L3\n",
    "files** the L3 file is derived from L2P data by a remapping process. The\n",
    "remapping and collating best practices are given in \n",
    "{numref}`l2_remapping_best_practice`. Their content is thus identical to that \n",
    "of the L2P, but complementary, optional information on the remapping conditions \n",
    "may be provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Adjusted files**: Collated files may or may not be adjusted, but a \n",
    "super-collated file is necessarily adjusted. The super-collating and adjustment \n",
    "best practices are described in {numref}`collating_best_practice` and \n",
    "{numref}`adjustment_best_practice`. The principle governing this format is to \n",
    "allow traceability to the original L2P, while providing the best-adjusted SST \n",
    "value. A first section (in blue in {numref}`l3_content`) reproduces the original \n",
    "L2P SST and SSES information as in the un-adjusted version. The reference used \n",
    "to adjust the SST must be given in the “reference” attribute of the \n",
    "`adjusted_sea_surface_temperature` variable. The adjusted SST and some error \n",
    "information are also mandatory. This information, in yellow in \n",
    "{numref}`l3_content`, is: \n",
    "- `adjusted_standard_deviation_error`: the total error resulting from the \n",
    "   combination of the SSES error and the adjustment procedure error, \n",
    "   `standard_deviation_to_reference_sst`.\n",
    "- `bias_to_reference_sst`: the local value of the estimated difference between\n",
    "  the original SST and the reference SST\n",
    "- `standard_deviation_to_reference_sst`: an estimate of the error resulting \n",
    "  from the adjustment procedure. If the procedure consists of analysing a field \n",
    "  of differences of original SST and reference SST, the \n",
    "  `standard_deviation_to_reference_sst` will be the error of this analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The GHRSST Science Team determined that 5 mandatory fields will form the core\n",
    "data content of a GHRSST L3 data file. In addition to global attributes and\n",
    "geo-location information, GHRSST producers must provide the following within \n",

    "### Remapping Level 2 Data to a Fixed Grid \n",
    "\n",
    "The remapping procedure consists in remapping the original L2P in swath\n",
    "projection onto a fixed grid. This remapping should preserve the traceability of\n",
    "the SST at pixel level and keep the best quality data.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the original and final grid resolutions are similar, the nearest pixel\n",
    "remapping should be adopted. To do so, either a “source to target” or a “target\n",
    "to source” approach may be used. The latter, target to source, which consists in\n",
    "scanning the target grid points to find the nearest pixel in the source, is\n",
    "recommended since it avoids creating holes in the remapped field.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the original grid resolution is finer than the output grid, \n",
    "{numref}`regridding1` an averaging procedure can be adopted. For these cases the\n",
    "best practice is to average the values of all pixels which overlap the product \n",
    "cell entirely and which have a L2P confidence record `quality_level` value equal\n",
    "to the highest encountered within the cell, to produce a single value.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} images/regridding1.png\n",
    "---\n",
    "name: regridding1\n",
    "---\n",
    "To illustrate the approach when the L3 product output grid is over-sampled by \n",
    "the L2P input data. All pixels labeled p in the input data are possible \n",
    "contributors to the value for new cell A.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The following practices are recommended by the GDS:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In the case of a smaller L2P input pixel than the grid cell size, L3 data \n",
    "   product cell values are derived from an average of the L2P pixel which \n",
    "   completely overlap the product cell and which have a L2P quality record \n",
    "   `quality_level` value equal to the highest encountered within the cell, \n",
    "   to produce a single value. \n",
    "2. For input pixels that straddle the boundary between output grid cells, a  \n",
    "   weighting function may be applied to the input values according to the \n",
    "   degree of coverage of the output grid cell and according to the SSES. \n",
    "3. Only the best quality original data within a grid cell should be averaged \n",
    "   to produce the resulting SST value, to preserve the homogeneity of the \n",
    "   SST quality (recommendation 1 above). In the case of averaging, the \n",
    "   number of contributors can be recorded as well as the sum of the SST \n",
    "   values and the sum of the square values of the SST. The SSES and \n",
    "   ancillary data (if needed, for instance if there may be more that one \n",
    "   SSES couple of values (bias and standard deviation) by quality level) \n",
    "   must be averaged accordingly: the `sses_bias` values are averaged \n",
    "   similarly as the SST values, the new `sses_standard_deviation` value is \n",
    "   the square root of the averaged squared values of the contributing \n",
    "   `sses_standard_deviations`. The averaging should account for the nature \n",
    "   of the original `l2P_flags`. \n",
    "4. In the case of a larger pixel than the L3 grid cell size, 2 approaches \n",
    "   can be adopted:\n",
    "   - The value of the L2P pixel is allocated to the grid cell the closest to \n",
    "     the pixel centre.\n",
    "   - The output grid cell takes the value of the L2P pixel in which its \n",
    "     centre lies. In this case the original latitudes and longitudes of the \n",
    "     pixel must be recorded, to be able to detect where the original L2P \n",
    "     pixel value has been duplicated.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If the original grid resolution is larger than the output grid (e.g., \n",
    "microwave instruments), as illustrated in {numref}`regridding2`, the following \n",
    "practices are recommended by the GDS:\n",

    "### Collating Data from the Same Sensor and Platform \n",
    "\n",
    "The collating procedure consists of gathering over a unique grid several orbits\n",
    "or slots (in the case of a geostationary satellite) of the same sensor on the\n",
    "same platform. This process is often known as “binning” the data. The collating\n",

    "\n",
    "1) For situations in which the collation is to be done for data collected within\n",
    "   the same day, two cases are met in practice: collation of consecutive orbits\n",
    "   in the case of data collected from polar orbiting sensors, or the merging of\n",
    "   consecutive slots in the case of geostationary satellites. In both cases\n",
    "   there may be multiple candidates for a grid cell.\n",
    "   a. To collate observations from overlapping orbits of the polar orbiting\n",
    "   sensors, the selection procedure should prioritize data first by using the\n",
    "   highest available quality data. If multiple observations share the same\n",
    "   highest quality, one of two approaches should be taken: either the\n",
    "   observation with the minimum satellite zenith angle should be selected, or\n",
    "   the observations should be averaged. If the minimum satellite zenith angle\n",
    "   approach is taken, the corresponding `sses_bias` and \n",
    "   `sses_standard_deviation` should be selected as well. If the averaging\n",
    "   approach is followed, the `sses_bias` and `sses_standard_deviation` should be\n",
    "   averaged similarly (note that the new `sses_standard_deviation` value is the\n",
    "   square root of the averaged squared values of the contributing\n",
    "   sses_standard_deviation values). Also in the case of averaging, it is good\n",
    "   practice to record the number of observations being averaged, the sum of the\n",
    "   SST values, and the sum of the squared SST values. These values can be stored\n",
    "   in the `or_number_pixels`, `sum_sst`, and `sum_square_sst` variables\n",
    "   listed in Sections and 8 and 9.\n",
    "   b. In the case of geostationary data, the selection procedure must prioritize\n",
    "   data showing the best quality level, and if equal, data closest to the\n",
    "   representative time (central time) of the L3 time window. In the case of\n",
    "   geostationary satellites, remapping is not a preliminary step to the\n",
    "   collating procedure.\n",
    "2) If averaging over multiple days, only the best quality original data within a\n",
    "   grid cell should be averaged to produce the resulting SST value, to preserve\n",
    "   the homogeneity of the SST quality. The number of contributors can be\n",
    "   recorded (`or_number_pixels`) as well as the sum of the SST values (\n",
    "   `sum_sst`) and the sum of the square values of the SST (`sum_square_sst`).\n",
    "   The SSES values should be averaged accordingly: the `sses_bias` values are\n",
    "   averaged in the same manner as the SST values and the new \n",
    "   `sses_standard_deviation` value is the square root of the averaged squared\n",
    "   values of the contributing `sses_standard_deviation` values. The averaging\n",
