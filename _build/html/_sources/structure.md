# GDS Data Product File Structure

## Overview of the GDS-{{gds_version}} netCDF File Format
GDS-{{gds_version}} data files preferentially use the netCDF-4 Classic format. A
major advantage to the use of NetCDF-4 format products is that it offers 
internal compression so that reading a given variable or some attributes 
does not require to explicitly decompress the entire file.

These GDS-{{gds_version}} formatted data sets must comply with the **Climate 
and Forecast (CF) Conventions, v1.7 or later** [^footnote1] because these 
conventions provide a practical standard for storing oceanographic data in a robust, 
easily-preserved for the long-term, and interoperable manner. The CF-compliant 
netCDF data format is flexible, self-describing, and has been adopted as a de 
facto standard for many operational and scientific oceanography systems.
Both netCDF and CF are actively maintained including significant discussions and
inputs from the oceanographic community. The CF convention generalizes and 
extends the **Cooperative Ocean/Atmosphere Research Data Service (COARDS) 
Convention** [^footnote2] but relaxes the COARDS constraints on dimension order
and specifies methods for reducing the size of datasets. The purpose of the CF 
Conventions is to require conforming datasets to contain sufficient metadata so 
that they are self-describing, in the sense that each variable in the file has 
an associated description of what it represents, physical units if appropriate,
and that each value can be located in space (relative to earth-based 
coordinates) and time. In addition to the CF Conventions, GDS-{{gds_version}}
formatted files follow some of the recommendations of the **Unidata Attribute 
Convention for Dataset Discovery (ACDD)** [^footnote3].

In the context of netCDF, a **variable** refers to data stored in the file as a 
vector or as a multidimensional array. Each variable in a GHRSST netCDF file 
consists of a 2-dimensional `[i x j]`, 3-dimensional `[i x j x k]`, or 
4-dimensional `[i x j x k x l]` array of data. The dimensions of each
variable must be explicitly declared in the dimension section.

Within the netCDF file, **global attributes** are used to hold information that 
applies to the whole file, such as the data set title. Each individual variable 
must also have its own attributes, referred to as **variable attributes**. 
These variable attributes define, for example, an **offset**, **scale factor**, 
**units**, a **descriptive version of the variable name**, and a **fill 
value**, which is used to indicate array elements that do not contain valid 
data. Where applicable, SI units should be used and described by a character 
string, which is compatible with the Unidata UDUNITS-2 package [^footnote4].

All GHRSST GDS-{{gds_version}} files conform to this structure and share a 
common set of netCDF global attributes. These global attributes include those 
required by the CF Convention plus additional ones required by the 
GDS-{{gds_version}}. The required set of global attributes is described in 
{numref}`global_attributes` and entities within the GHRSST R/GTS framework are 
free to add their own, as long as they do not contradict the 
GDS-{{gds_version}} and CF requirements.

Following the CF convention, each variable also has a set of variable 
attributes. The required variable attributes are described in 
{numref}`variable_attributes`. In a few cases, some of these variable attributes
may not be relevant for certain variables or additional variable attributes may 
be required. In those cases, the variable descriptions in each of the 
[L2P](./l2p.md), [L3](./l3.md), [L4](./l4.md) product specifications will 
identify the differences and specify requirements for each product. As with the 
global attributes, entities within the GHRSST R/GTS framework are free to add 
their own variable attributes, as long as they do not contradict the 
GDS-{{gds_version}} and CF requirements.

While the exact volumes can vary, an average L2P file will use about 33 bytes 
per pixel, an L3 file 28 bytes per pixel, and an L4 file about 8 bytes per 
pixel. The data type encodings for each variable are fixed except for the 
experimental fields, which are flexible and can chosen by the GHRSST producer.

## Global Attributes
{numref}`__global_attributes` below summarizes the global attributes that are 
mandatory for every GDS-{{gds_version}} netCDF data file. More details on the 
CF-mandated attributes (as indicated in the *Source* column) are available at: 
http://cfconventions.org/cf-conventions/cf-conventions.html#attribute-appendix 
and information on the ACDD recommendations is available at

Note that if geospatial_vertical_positive is down ('depth' orientation), the geospatial_vertical_min attribute specifies the data's vertical location furthest from the earth's center, and the geospatial_vertical_max attribute specifies the location closest to the earth's center.<br>                                                                                                                                                                                                       | `geospatial_vertical_positive = 'down' ;`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | ACDD 1.1<br>ACDD 1.3 |
| `geospatial_bounds`              | string  | Describes the data's 2D or 3D geospatial extent in OGC's Well-Known Text (WKT) Geometry format (reference the OGC Simple Feature Access (SFA) specification). The meaning and order of values for each point's coordinates depends on the coordinate reference system (CRS). The ACDD default is 2D geometry in the EPSG:4326 coordinate reference system. The default may be overridden with geospatial_bounds_crs and geospatial_bounds_vertical_crs (see those attributes). EPSG:4326 coordinate values are latitude (decimal degrees_north) and longitude (decimal degrees_east), in that order. Longitude values in the default case are limited to the (-180, 180) range. Example: "POLYGON ((40.26 -111.29, 41.26 -111.29, 41.26 -110.29, 40.26 -110.29, 40.26 -111.29))". | `geospatial_bounds = "(-143.09, -63.1404, -88.893, -36.7432)" ;`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | ACDD 1.1 ACDD 1.3  |
| `geospatial_bounds_crs`          | string  | The coordinate reference system (CRS) of the point coordinates in the geospatial_bounds attribute. This CRS may be 2-dimensional or 3-dimensional, but together with geospatial_bounds_vertical_crs, if that attribute is supplied, must match the dimensionality, order, and meaning of point coordinate values in the geospatial_bounds attribute. If geospatial_bounds_vertical_crs is also present then this attribute must only specify a 2D CRS. EPSG CRSs are strongly recommended. If this attribute is not specified, the CRS is assumed to be EPSG:4326. Examples: "EPSG:4979" (the 3D WGS84 CRS), "EPSG:4047".                                                                                                                                                         | `geospatial_bounds_crs = "WGS84" ;`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | ACDD 1.3           |
| `geospatial_bounds_vertical_crs` | string  | The vertical coordinate reference system (CRS) for the Z axis of the point coordinates in the geospatial_bounds attribute. This attribute cannot be used if the CRS in geospatial_bounds_crs is 3-dimensional; to use this attribute, geospatial_bounds_crs must exist and specify a 2D CRS. EPSG CRSs are strongly recommended. There is no default for this attribute when not specified.

| `grid_mapping`            | String                                      | Describes the horizontal coordinate system used by the data. The grid_mapping attribute should point to a variable which would contain the parameters corresponding to the coordinate system. That named variable is called a grid mapping variable and is of arbitrary type since it contains no data. Its purpose is to act as a container for the attributes that define the mapping. There are typically several parameters associated with each coordinate system. CF defines a separate attributes for each of the parameters. Some examples are ""semi_major_axis"", ""inverse_flattening"", ""false_easting"".

| `flag_meanings`           | String                                      | Define the physical meaning of each flag_masks bit field with a single text string. CF allows a single variable to contain both flag_values and flag_masks. The interpretation of the flags in such cases is slightly tricky. In such cases flag_masks is used to "group" a set of flag_values into a nested conditional. Words within a phrase should be connected with underscores. Please see the example 3.5 in the CF document on how to interpret flag_meanings in such cases. NCEI recommends that boolean and enumerated flags be kept in separate variables.                                                                                                                                                                               | `flag_meanings = "microwave land ice lake river" ;`                             | CF 1.7+                     |
| `flag_values`             | Must be the same as the variable type       | Its values identify the flagged conditions by performing a bitwise AND of the variable value and each flag masks value. For example, if the variable value is of type unsigned byte and equal to 5 and the flag_masks are 1b, 2b, 4b, 8b, 16b, 32b. The binary encoding of 5 is 00000101 and the binary encoding of the flags are 00000001, 00000010, 00000100, 00001000, 00010000, 00100000. Now bitwide AND of the value with the masks returns 00000001, 00000000, 00000100, 00000000, 00000000, 00000000 respectively or 1b,0,4b,0,0,0,0,0 in decimal. So the masks corresponding to 1b and 4b are ""true"", rest are ""false"".

| `flag_masks`              | Must be the same as the variable type       | A number of independent Boolean conditions using bit field notation by setting unique bits in each flag_masks value.
