# Level 4 (L4) Product Specification

## Overview description of the GHRSST L4 data product
L4 products are the analyzed SST products, usually derived from GHRSST L2P 
products. L4 data products should ideally be made available within the 
GHRSST R/GTS framework to the user community within 24 hours.

L4 products include gap-free analyzed SST data together with a number of 
ancillary fields that simplify interpretation and application of the SST 
data. Data providers are responsible for providing documentation on their 
analysis procedure. The common format of L4 products allows data users to 
code with the security that as new SST data products are brought on-line, 
very minimal code changes are required to make full use of a new L4 product. 
Time previously spent on coding different I/O routines for each satellite 
data set can be spent working with the data to produce results.

The GHRSST Science Team determined that there will be 4 mandatory fields 
that form the core data content of a GHRSST L4 data file. In addition to global
attributes and geo-location information, producers must include the following 
within a L4 file:
- Sea Surface temperature data (SST)
- Error estimates for SST data
- Sea ice fraction (only and sea ice covered areas)
- Land/sea/ice flag

In addition, there are a number of optional fields that may be used at the 
data providerâ€™s discretion.

The GHRSST L4 file contents are summarized in {numref}`l4_content_summary` 
below.

```{table} Summary description of the contents within a GHRSST L4 data product
:name: l4_content_summary
| Description                            | Required  |
|----------------------------------------|-----------|
| **Coordinate variables**  | Information to permit locating data on grids, as defined in {numref}`coordinate_variables` | 
| **Data record variables** | Core and auxiliary variables as defined in {numref}`l4_records`  | 
| **Global Attributes**     | A collection of required global attributes describing general characteristics of the file, as defined in section {numref}`global_attributes`  |
```


## L4 data record format specification
L4 analysed data products are derived from an analysis procedure implemented 
at  regular intervals (daily, six-hourly or other time periods). L4 data
products include SST, error statistics, sea ice fraction, land/sea/ice mask,
and  other optional data for each grid-cell. A **6-byte** experimental block 
is available for data providers to test new aspects of the file or 
information specific to the analysis system that will eventually transition 
into a GHRSST standard L4 analysis field once tested.

{numref}`l4_records` describes the format of GDS L4 variables that should be 
created for each L4 grid cell. In the following sections, each  variable 
within the L4 data file is described in detail.


```{table} L4 SST product data records
:name: l4_records
| Variable Name          | Description            | Units  | Storage type |
|-----------------------|------------------------|--------|-----|
| [analysed_sst](__l4_analysed_sst) | SST from analysis system | K (kelvin) | short |
| [analysis_error](__l4_analysis_error) | Error standard deviation estimate | K (kelvin) | short |
| [sea_ice_fraction](__l4_sea_ice_fraction) | Fractional Sea Ice area concentration | 1 (unitless) | byte |
| [sea_ice_fraction_error](__l4_sea_ice_fraction_error) | If the error estimates on the sea ice field are available, it is recommended to provide this information as an experimental field | 1 (unitless) | byte |
| [mask](__l4_mask) | land/ice/lake mask | | byte |
| [other fields](__l4_optional_fields) | Optional/experimental fields defined by data provider | | |
```

(__l4_analysed_sst)=
### `analysed_sst`
The variable `analysed_sst` will be included with the format requirements shown 
in {numref}`l4_analysed_sst`.

The data provider is responsible for providing GHRSST with documentation on 
how the analysed SST is determined. Note that the RDAC should place the
`_FillValue` value in pixels that fall on land.

```{table} CDL example description of **<span style="font-family:courier;">analysed_sst</span>** variable
:name: l4_analysed_sst

| **Storage type** | **Name**     | **Description**                  | **Unit** |
|-------------------|--------------|----------------------------------|----------|
| short             | `analysed_sst` | SST values from analysis systems | K (kelvin)   |
```

```{code-cell}

!ncdump -h samples/l4_full_example.nc | grep $'[ , \t]analysed_sst[(,:]'| sed 's/[[:space:]]//'
```

(__l4_analysis_error)=
## `analysis_error`
The variable `analysis_error` will be included with the format requirements 
shown in  {numref}`l4_analysis_error`.

The data provider is responsible for providing GHRSST with documentation on how
`analysis_error` is determined.

```{table} CDL example description of <span style="font-family:courier;">analysis\_error</span> variable
:name: l4_analysis_error
| **Storage type** | **Name**       | **Description**                     | **Unit** |
|-------------------|----------------|-------------------------------------|----------|
| short             | `analysis_error` | Error estimate from analysis system | K (kelvin)   |
```

```{code-cell}
:tags: [remove-input]

!ncdump -h samples/l4_full_example.nc | grep $'[ , \t]analysis_error[(,:]'| sed 's/[[:space:]]//'
```

(__l4_sea_ice_fraction)=
## `sea_ice_fraction`
The variable sea_ice_fraction will be included with the format requirements 
shown in {numref}`l4_sea_ice_fraction`.

Some SST data are contaminated in part or wholly by sea ice and the L4 variable
`sea_ice_fraction` is used to quantify the fraction of an area contaminated 
with sea ice. If the error estimates on the sea ice field are available, it 
is recommended to provide this information as an experimental variable called 
`sea_ice_fraction_error`.

```{table} CDL example description of **<span style="font-family:courier;">sea\_ice\_fraction</span>** variable
:name: l4_sea_ice_fraction
| **Storage type** | **Name**         | **Description**                       | **Unit**  |
|-------------------|------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------|
| byte              | `sea_ice_fraction` | Fractional sea ice area concentration | 1 (unitless)  |
```
```{code-cell}
:tags: [remove-input]

!ncdump -h samples/l4_full_example.nc | grep $'[ , \t]sea_ice_fraction[(,:]'| sed 's/[[:space:]]//'
```

(__l4_mask)=
## `mask`
The variable `mask` will be included with the format requirements shown in {numref}`l4_mask`.


```{table} CDL example description of **<span style="font-family:courier;">mask</span>** variable
:name: l4_mask

| **Storage type** | **Name** | **Description**        | **Unit** |
|-------------------|----------|------------------------|----------|
| byte              | `mask`     | land/sea/ice/lake mask | none     |
```
```{code-cell}
:tags: [remove-input]

!ncdump -h samples/l4_full_example.nc | grep $'[ , \t]mask[(,:]'| sed 's/[[:space:]]//'
```

```{admonition} Comments:
Comments
This is a land/sea/ice mask with the following bit values:
- Bit 0:1 = water in grid
- Bit 1:1 = land in grid
- Bit 2:1 = optional, lake surface in grid
- Bit 3:1 = sea ice
- Bit 4:1 = optional, river surface in grid
- Bits [5-7] spare

Note that the lake and river surface bit values are optional.

The `source` attribute should list any data product used in creating this 
mask, a semi-colon separated list of identifiers 
**<span style="font-family:courier;">\<provider\>\_\<type\_of\_mask\>\_\<version_mask\></span>**.
```

(__l4_sea_ice_fraction_error)=
## Optional Variable **<span style="font-family:courier;">sea_ice_fraction_error</span>**
If the error estimates on the sea ice field are available, it is recommended 
to provide this information as an optional field called 
`sea_ice_fraction_error`. The data provider is responsible for providing 
GHRSST with documentation on how `sea_ice_fraction_error` is estimated.


```{table} CDL example description of **<span style="font-family:courier;">sea_ice_fraction_error</span>** variable

### Optional experimental L4 variables included by data provider

Flexibility of L4 product content is provided through the netCDF API, which
allows fully self-describing fields and additional L4 variables may be included
by L4 data providers if they are considered relevant for L4 users. The GDS-{{gds_version}}
also permits the inclusion of R&D variables (e.g. estimates of sea 
ice fraction error, SST anomaly, etc.) and 6 bytes per pixel are available in
total for optional/experimental variables in any combination (i.e., variables 
can be defined as 6 x byte, 3 x short, 2 x short + 2 x byte, etc). The use of
optional/experimental variables provides a limited amount of flexibility within
the GDS-{{gds_version}} for regional user requirements while maintaining an overall upper
limit on GDS-{{gds_version}} L4 products for data management groups and 
archive scaling. In exceptional cases a waiver on the 6 byte ceiling can be 
requested to extend up to 12 bytes per pixel.

The GDS-{{gds_version}} issues the following guidance on the inclusion of optional or
experimental variables within L4 data products:

- The sum total of all experimental variables shall not increase L4 record 
  size by more than **6 bytes** per SST pixel. A **waiver** can be requested 
  for higher amounts up to 12 bytes.
- CF-1.7 or later compliance should be maintained for all 
  optional/experimental variables. Where available, a standard_name 
  attribute should be used.
- It is permitted to use a provider defined coordinate variable associated 
  with experimental fields but this shall be documented in data provider  
  documentation.
- Time difference data (dtime values) should be provided for variables when 
  appropriate.
- The source of data should be indicated: in the single source case as a 
  variable attribute; as a dedicated variable when mixed data sources are 
  present.
- Use of experimental variables requires clear documentation by the GHRSST 
  producer. They shall provide adequate documentation that describes each 
  variable following the CDL examples provided in this document.
- The variable attribute `comment` shall be used to provide a URL link to a 
  full description of each data producer defined variable included in the 
  L4 product.
- Experimental L4 variables if present in an L4 product will be included 
  with the minimum format requirements shown in {numref}`__l4_sea_ice_fraction_error`
- Additional global variables may be declared within the L4 product.
