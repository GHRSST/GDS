# 9 Level 2 Pre-processed (L2P) Product Specification

## 9.1 Overview description of the GHRSST L2P data product

The GHRSST Level-2 Pre-processed (L2P) products are the basic building blocks from which all other GHRSST SST data products can be derived. L2P data products should ideally be made available within the GHRSST R/GTS framework to the user community in real time within 3 hours after the reception of data at the satellite. For every L2P file that is generated, appropriate ISO metadata (specified in **Section 12.1**) must also be created and registered at the GHRSST Master Metadata Repository (MMR) system (see **[AD-1]** for more details).

L2P products include SST data as delivered by a data provider in their native format (swath, grid, or vector), together with a number of ancillary fields that simplify interpretation an application of the SST data. The main difference between input L2 SST data file and the output GHRSST L2P data file is that additional confidence data and sensor specific error estimates for each pixel value are included and the original SST data files are reformatted into the L2P specification. No adjustments to the input L2 SST measurements are allowed but instead, sensor specific error statistics are used to provide bias error and standard deviation estimates. A user wishing to correct L2P SST data can apply these estimates to the SST values directly. Full orbit input data files may be split into ascending and descending files or smaller granules and a unique L2P output may be generated for each file. The common format of L2P products allows data users to code with the security so that as new satellite derived SST data sets are brought on-line, very minimal code changes are required to make full use of new L2P data. Time previously spent on coding different i/o routines for each satellite data set can now be spent applying the data to various applications and societal benefits instead. 

The GHRSST Science Team agreed at the 6th GHRSST Science Team Meeting, Met Office, Exeter, United Kingdom, May 14th – 20th 2005, 6 mandatory fields form the core data content of a GHRSST L2P data file. These fields will be known as L2P ‘core’ (L2Pcore) fields. In addition to metadata records, global attributes and geo-location and time information, RDACs must produce the following L2Pcore within an L2P file:

- Sea Surface Temperature data (sea_surface_temperature)
- Time differences of SST measurements from a reference time (sst_dtime)
- SST Sensor Specific Error Statistic (SSES) measurement bias estimate (sses_bias)
- SSES measurement standard deviation estimate (sses_standard_deviation)
- Flags specific to each L2P data set that help users interpret data (l2p_flags)
- A quality level for each measurement (quality_level)

In addition there are a number of auxiliary fields (L2Paux) that must be provided before the L2P data product is admitted into the GHRSST R/GTS:
- dt_analysis – the difference between satellite SST measurements and a defined reference climatology of SST
- An estimate of surface wind speed (wind_speed)
- An estimate of sea ice fraction (sea_ice_fraction)
- An estimate of atmospheric aerosol (as an aerosol dynamic indicator, aerosol_dyanamic_indicator)

When an L2P file contains all L2Pcore and L2Paux fields together with full L2P ISO metadata, it will be called a full-L2P file. Best practice dictates that RDACs should add the remaining auxiliary fields (L2Paux) prior to submission at the GDAC. Only full L2P data files should be registered and ingested at the GHRSST GDAC and LTSRF system. These distinctions will assist in the data management of the GHRSST GDS-2.1.

Missing L2Paux fields not provided by an RDAC may be added by the GDAC with prior arrangement. In this case data required the L2Paux files will be procured, checked for quality and interpolated or processed according to the GDS-2.1 specification by the GDAC.

Optional experimental fields may be used by RDAC to provide additional information at the data provider’s discretion. It may be necessary to use an additional netCDF coordinate variable when including experimental fields.

GDS-2.1 L2P data products are configured as shown in [Table 9-1](#table9-1), which can be used to locate appropriate information in this document.

The GHRSST L4 analysis chosen for a given L2P data set variable should be consistent for all L2P products as far as practically possible.  If no L4 analysis is available then an alternative L4 analysis or a reference mean SST climatology may be used.  If storage as byte does not allow the provider to offer the full precision required for this field, storage as a short is optionally permitted though byte is preferred.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | kelvin byte (or short) |
| wind_speed (Section , )                                             | 10 m surface wind speed near contemporaneous to the input SST measurement from satellite or analysis.  Wind speed data should be provided at a minimum resolution of 1 ms-1 and data producers shall use scale_factor and add_offset to scale data to an appropriate resolution (higher resolution is better).  The difference in time between SST measurement and wind_speed data shall be recorded in the L2P variable wind_speed_dtime_from_sst. If all the times have the same value, then using an attribute wind_speed:time_offset is sufficient and the variable wind_speed_dtime_from_sst is not required.

| aerosol_dynamic_indicator (Section , )                              |  The variable aerosol_dynamic_indicator (ADI) is used to indicate the presence of atmospheric aerosols that may cause errors in the atmospheric correction of infrared satellite data when retrieving SST.  The variable aerosol_dynamic_indicator is mandatory only when the input SST data set has been derived from an infrared satellite instrument.   The atmospheric aerosol data used to fill the variable aerosol_dynamic_indicator is chosen by the data provider as the most appropriate aerosol indicator for a given input SST data set. (e.g., SDI might be used for MSG SEVIRI, a view difference might be used for AATSR, and aerosol optical depth may be used from a model or another satellite system).  When multiple sources of atmospheric aerosol indicator data are used in the variable aerosol_dynamic_indicator, the variable source_of_adi shall be used to record the source of the aerosol indicator data used. In addition, the units of all sources used in the file shall be identical.  If a unique source of atmospheric aerosol indicator data is used (this is recommended), the variable attribute 'aerosol_dynamic_indicator:source = "<string defined by best practice in Section >" is sufficient and the variable source_of_aerosol_dynamic_indicator is not required.

| l2p_flags (Section , )                                              |  The variable l2p_flags is used to (a) specify the type of input SST data (either infrared or passive microwave instrument derived), (b) pass through native flags from the input L2 SST data set and (c) record any additional information considered important for the user of an L2P data set. 

The variable l2p_flags is split into two sections: the first 6 bits of the L2P variable l2p_flags are generic flags that are common to all L2P data files; bits 6-15 are defined by the L2P data provider and are specific to each L2 input data stream.

The tables below define the bit field and their meanings. The least significant bit (bit 0) starts on the right.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Bit | Common flags           |   |

## 9.5 Variable sses_bias 
Providing uncertainty estimates for each SST measurement is one of the key user requirements for GHRSST L2P SST data products. Uncertainty estimates allow users to select the accuracy level suitable for their application and to make optimum use of the SST observations (e.g. in data assimilation).

The uncertainties associated with each observation in a data stream are provided as Sensor Specific Error Statistic (SSES) https://www.ghrsst.org/resources/single-sensor-error-statistic-sses/. The SSES are based on understanding the errors associated with the in-flight performance of an individual satellite instrument for the retrieval of SST from the measured radiances. The SSES are provided as a mean bias error and its associated standard deviation.

There are a variety of methods for determining SSES as they depend on the specific characteristics of each satellite instrument. Consequently, the L2P provider can define their own scheme for producing SSES that is tailored to their specific dataset. However, the SSES scheme must conform to a set of agreed SSES common principles.

The SSES common principles are maintained on the GHRSST website at https://www.ghrsst.org/resources/single-sensor-error-statistic-sses/, and have been approved by the GHRSST Science Team. The L2P provider must provide documentation that summarizes the theoretical basis of their SSES scheme, its implementation, any recommendations for users, and its conformance to the agreed SSES common principles. The SSES documentation will be maintained through the GHRSST website at https://www.ghrsst.org/resources/single-sensor-error-statistic-sses/. 

The variable ‘sses_bias’ is used to store SSES bias estimates and shall be included with the L2P format requirements shown in [Table 9-6](#table9-6). Data producers are reminded to choose appropriate scale_factors and add_offsets for their data, and to strive for scale_factors as close to 0.01 as possible without “oversaturating” the values.

## 9.6 Variable sses_standard_deviation
SSES standard deviation estimates are generated by the L2P data provider and are specific to a particular satellite instrument, and must conform to the SSES common principles. The SSES common principles are maintained on the GHRSST website at https://www.ghrsst.org/resources/single-sensor-error-statistic-sses/, and have been approved by the GHRSST Science Team. The L2P provider must provide documentation that summarises the theoretical basis of their SSES scheme, its implementation, any recommendations for users, and its conformance to the agreed SSES common principles. The SSES documentation will be maintained through the GHRSST website at https://www.ghrsst.org/resources/single-sensor-error-statistic-sses/.

The variable ‘sses_standard_deviation’ shall be included with the format requirements shown in [Table 9-7](#table9-7). Data producers are reminded to choose appropriate scale_factors and add_offsets for their data, and to strive for scale_factors as close to 0.01 as possible without “oversaturating” the values.

## 9.6 Variable dt_analysis
The L2P variable **dt_analysis** is the temperature difference between an input L2 SST measurement and a reference SST L4 analysis data set. **dt_analysis** may be used to indicate potential areas of diurnal variability or gross outliers in the L2 input SST measurement data set by looking for large deviations from the previous analysis SST data. Note that **dt_analysis** is an indicator field and the temperature anomalies may be difficult to interpret in regions of high SST gradients. Furthermore, interpretation requires a good understanding of the strengths and weaknesses (e.g. space and time de-correlations) of the chosen reference L4 analysis system. 

The GDS-2.1 specifies the following:

  **dt_analysis** shall be derived using:
<a id="equation9-1"></a>
##### Equation 9-1 
```{math}
dt_analysis = SSTinput – L4SST
```

  Where SSTinput is the input satellite L2 measurement and L4SST is a previous day analysis from a GHRSST L4 System selected by the data provider. If a previous analysis SSTfnd data file is not 
  available for use in [Equation 9-1](#equation9-1), then a mean reference SST or climatology should be used in its place as defined in [Table 9-8](#table9-8).

The **dt_analysis** value shall be inserted into the **dt_analysis** field of the L2P product for the pixel in question as described in [Table 9-9](#table9-9)

## 9.6 Variable wind_speed
The L2P variable **wind_speed** contains a best estimate of the **10m surface wind speed, ideally at the time of SST data acquisition** (although this is rarely possible). Wind speed measurements are required within the GDS as an indicator of the turbulent state of the air sea interface to interpret the relationship between satellite and subsurface SST data and assess the severity of any skin SST temperature deviation, thermal stratification and for use in diurnal variability adjustment schemes. At low wind speeds, especially in clear sky conditions, stronger diurnal variability is expected leading to higher surface layer temperature gradients and the potential for significant de-coupling of the skin/sub-skin SST from the SST at depth.

Ideally a near contemporaneous wind speed measurement from satellite sensors should be used but this is impossible for all sensors due to the limited number of satellite wind speed sensors available. As a surrogate for a measured wind speed value, analysis product estimates (e.g., from numerical weather prediction models) may be used as an indication of the surface wind speed. The GDS specifies the following rules:

A 10m surface wind speed value assigned to each SST measurement pixel using the variable **‘wind_speed’**. The following criteria shall apply:

- Simultaneous microwave 10m wind speed measurements obtained from the same instrument providing the SST measurement shall be used when available to set the L2P confidence data variable **wind_speed**.

- In the absence of a simultaneous surface wind speed measurement, an analysis product estimated 10m surface wind speed shall be used to set the L2P variable wind_speed.

The difference in time expressed in hours between the time of SST measurement and the time of wind speed data should be entered into the L2P confidence data variable **wind_speed_dtime_from_sst** as described in **Section 9.9**. In the case of an analysis field, this should be the central (mean) time of an integrated value. If all of the wind speeds have a single time value, as in the case of an analysis or model that gives the wind speeds at an instant in time, then the **wind_speed_dtime_from_sst** variable is not needed and instead a variable level attribute named **time_offset** is used. The attribute **time_offset** should store the difference in hours between the **wind_speed** and the reference time, stored in the variable **time**.

If a single source of data is used in the L2P variable **wind_speed**, the L2P variable **source_of_wind_speed** is not required and the **wind_speed:source** attribute value is sufficient. In that case, it shall be a single source text string defined by the data provider using the text string naming best practice given in **Section 7.9**.

If multiple sources of data are used, source information should be indicated in the L2P variable **source_of_wind_speed** as defined by the data provider and as described in detail in **Section 9.10**, and the **wind_speed:source** attribute shall have the value **"source_of_wind_speed"**. In addition, the units of all sources used in the file shall be identical.

The GDS L2P variable wind_speed shall be included in GDS-2.1 L2P products with the format requirements shown in [Table 9-9](#table9-9).

## 9.7 Variable wind_speed_dtime_from_sst
The variable wind_speed_dtime_from_sst reports the time difference between wind speed data and SST measurement in hours. The variable ‘wind_speed_dtime_from_sst’ shall be included with the format requirements shown in [Table 9-10](#table9-10). In the case of an analysis field, the central (mean) time of an integrated value should be used. If all of the values are the same, this variable is not required. Instead, use the variable level attribute named time_offset with the variable wind_speed.

## 9.8 Variable source_of_wind_speed 
The source of data used to set the L2P ancillary data variable **wind_speed** shall be indicated in the L2P variable **source_of_wind_speed** when more than one source of wind speed data is used in the L2P product. When only one source is used, this variable is not needed and the appropriate text string indicating the source is placed in the **source** attribute of the **wind_speed** variable. For multiple sources, the GDS-2.1 requires the following:

- The variable in question should contain an attribute called **flag_meanings** and another one called **flag_values**. The **flag_values** attribute shall contain a comma-separated list of the numeric codes for the sources of data used whose order matches the comma-separated text strings in the **flag_meanings** attribute.

- These text strings and numeric codes do not need to be unique across different data sets or even ancillary variables, but must be consistent within a given variable and clearly specified within each netCDF variable and its attributes. A best practice for naming the text strings in provided in **Section 7.9**.

- The variable **‘source_of_wind_speed’** shall conform to the format requirements shown in [Table 9-11](#table9-11).

## 9.9 Variable sea_ice_fraction 
Some SST data are contaminated in part or wholly by sea ice and the L2P variable **sea_ice_fraction** is used to quantify the fraction of an area contaminated with sea ice. Some input SST data streams provide a flag to indicate that the SST measurement is contaminated by sea ice (e.g., AMSR-E). The GDS-2.1 specifies the following rules:

If an input data set pixel fractional sea ice estimate exists, this should be used to in the L2P variable **sea_ice_fraction** as described [Table 9-12](#table9-12).

Best practice suggests that one should approach the issue in the following way. If an input data set pixel sea ice flag does not exist, and the pixel is located in or close to a region that may be ice contaminated, a reference sea ice data set defined should be used to determine the value of the L2P confidence flag **sea_ice_fraction**.

If an input data set pixel sea ice **flag** exists (i.e. indicating sea ice but not the fractional amount of coverage), this should be used to set the L2P variable **sea_ice_fraction** to 1. 

If the SST input data set includes a sea ice flag in the data stream, bit 3 of the L2P confidence data variable **l2p_flag** should be set for this pixel as described in **Section 9.17**.

The difference in time expressed in hours between the time of SST measurement and the time of sea ice fraction measurement should be entered into the L2P variable **sea_ice_fraction_dtime_from_sst** as described in **Section 9.12**. In the case of an analysis field, this should be the central (mean) time of an integrated value. . If all of the ice observations have a single time value, as in the case of an analysis or model that gives the sea ice values at an instant in time, then the **sea_ice_fraction_dtime_from_sst** variable is not needed and instead a variable level attribute named **time_offset** is used. The attribute **time_offset** should store the difference in hours between the **sea_ice_fraction** and the reference time, stored in the variable **time**.

If a single source of data is used in the L2P variable **sea_ice_fraction**, the L2P variable **source_of_sea_ice_fraction** is not required and instead the **sea_ice_fraction:source** attribute value is sufficient. It shall be a single source text string defined by the data provider using the text string naming best practice given in **Section 7.9**.

If multiple sources of data are used, source information should be indicated in the L2P variable **source_of_sea_ice_fraction** as defined by the data provider and as described in detail in **Section 9.13**, and the **sea_ice_fraction:source** attribute shall have the value **"source_of_sea_ice_fraction"**. In addition, the units of all sources used in the file shall be identical.

The variable attribute **sea_ice_fraction:sea_ice_treatment** shall specify how the sea ice information has been treated by the data provider. Valid options are: "Use unmodified (one source)”, “use unmodified (multiple ice sources)”, or “modified using onboard sensors"

The variable **sea_ice_fraction** will be included with the format requirements shown in [Table 9-12](#table9-12).

## 9.10 Variable sea_ice_fraction_dtime_from_sst
The variable **sea_ice_fraction_dtime_from_sst** reports the time difference between sea ice fraction data from SST measurement in hours. The variable **sea_ice_fraction_dtime_from_sst** shall be included with the format requirements shown in [Table 9-13](#table9-13). In the case of an analysis field, this should be the central (mean) time of an integrated value. If all of the values are the same, this variable is not required. Instead, use the variable level attribute named **time_offset** with the variable **sea_ice_fraction**. The attribute **time_offset** should store the difference in hours between the sea_ice_fraction and the reference time, stored in the variable **time**.
