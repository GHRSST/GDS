# Level 3 (L3) Product Specification

## Overview description of the GHRSST L3 data product

GHRSST L3 data have been introduced to provide users with gridded, synthetic,
and potentially adjusted SST products, bringing added value with respect to the
original L2P but still allowing traceability to the original dataset. GHRSST L3
products do not use analysis or interpolation procedure to fill gaps where no
observations are available. The GHRSST L3 products include:

- **Un-collated** data that represent a straightforward remapping of L2P GHRSST
  data granules to a space grid without combining any observations from
  overlapping orbits or times. Although in principle these data may or may not
  be adjusted to a reference sensor, in practice the un-collated L3 will
  normally be a remapped L2P dataset. For remapping best practices of L2P on 
  a  grid, see {numref}`l2_remapping_best_practice`.
- **Collated** data that grid observations from a single instrument and a single
  platform into space and/or time bins. These data may or may not be adjusted to
  a reference sensor. For collating best practices, see 
  {numref}`collating_best_practice` and for adjustment best practices see
  {numref}`adjustment_best_practice`.
- **Super-collated** data that combine observations from a multiple instruments
  into a space-time grid. In this case, the adjustment to a common reference is
  necessary to avoid heterogeneities in the resulting field. For best practices
  concerning the creation of super collated files see
  {numref}`supercollating_best_practice`

As a result, the format of a L3 file will be able to cope with the three kinds
of L3 SST presented above. The L3 format will include the following parts:

1. **In case the L3 is un-adjusted**, a mandatory section containing the 
   original L2P information remapped onto the grid point: the original sea 
   surface temperature, quality level and SSES information. An optional 
   section including the remapping condition information may also be 
   provided. These files are essentially gridded L2P files.
2. **In case the L3 is adjusted to a reference**, the adjusted SST value must 
   be provided, together with the local bias to the reference, the error 
   generated by the adjustment processing, and the overall error resulting 
   from the combination of the SSES and the adjustment processing error.
3. **In case the L3 is super-collated**, the source of SST at each pixel is 
   mandatory.

**Un-adjusted files**: In the case of **un-collated or collated un-adjusted L3
files** the L3 file is derived from L2P data by a remapping process. The
remapping and collating best practices are given in 
{numref}`l2_remapping_best_practice`. Their content is thus identical to that 
of the L2P, but complementary, optional information on the remapping conditions 
may be provided.

**Adjusted files**: Collated files may or may not be adjusted, but a 
super-collated file is necessarily adjusted. The super-collating and adjustment 
best practices are described in {numref}`collating_best_practice` and 
{numref}`adjustment_best_practice`. The principle governing this format is to 
allow traceability to the original L2P, while providing the best-adjusted SST 
value. A first section (in blue in {numref}`l3_content`) reproduces the original 
L2P SST and SSES information as in the un-adjusted version. The reference used 
to adjust the SST must be given in the “reference” attribute of the 
`adjusted_sea_surface_temperature` variable. The adjusted SST and some error 
information are also mandatory. This information, in yellow in 
{numref}`l3_content`, is: 
- `adjusted_standard_deviation_error`: the total error resulting from the 
   combination of the SSES error and the adjustment procedure error, 
   `standard_deviation_to_reference_sst`.
- `bias_to_reference_sst`: the local value of the estimated difference between
  the original SST and the reference SST
- `standard_deviation_to_reference_sst`: an estimate of the error resulting 
  from the adjustment procedure. If the procedure consists of analysing a field 
  of differences of original SST and reference SST, the 
  `standard_deviation_to_reference_sst` will be the error of this analysis.

The GHRSST Science Team determined that 5 mandatory fields will form the core
data content of a GHRSST L3 data file. In addition to global attributes and
geo-location information, GHRSST producers must provide the following within 
a L3 file:
- Sea Surface temperature data (SST),
- Time of SST measurement,
- Bias and Standard Deviation error estimates for SST data,
- Data quality.

There are a number of optional fields that may be used at the data provider’s
discretion that will form the core data content of a GHRSST data
file ({numref}`l3_data_records`).

The GHRSST L3 file contents are summarized in {numref}`l3_content` below.

## L3 data record format specification

This table provides an overview of the GHRSST L3 product pixel data record that
should be created for each input data. Within GHRSST L3 data files, there are
many variables that are defined identically to their L2P counterparts. In
addition, there are several variables that are unique to L3. Both types are
listed below in {numref}`l3_data_records`. In the following sections, each 
variable within the L3 data file that is unique to L3 is described in detail.

## Best Practices

(l2_remapping_best_practice)=
### Remapping Level 2 Data to a Fixed Grid 

The remapping procedure consists in remapping the original L2P in swath
projection onto a fixed grid. This remapping should preserve the traceability of
the SST at pixel level and keep the best quality data.

If the original and final grid resolutions are similar, the nearest pixel
remapping should be adopted. To do so, either a “source to target” or a “target
to source” approach may be used. The latter, target to source, which consists in
scanning the target grid points to find the nearest pixel in the source, is
recommended since it avoids creating holes in the remapped field.

If the original grid resolution is finer than the output grid, as 
illustrated in {numref}`regridding1`, an averaging procedure can be adopted. 
For these cases the best practice is to average the values of all pixels which 
overlap the product cell entirely and which have a L2P confidence record `quality_level` value equal
to the highest encountered within the cell, to produce a single value.

```{figure} images/regridding1.png
---
name: regridding1
---
To illustrate the approach when the L3 product output grid is over-sampled by 
the L2P input data. All pixels labeled p in the input data are possible 
contributors to the value for new cell A.
```

The following practices are recommended by the GDS:

1. In the case of a smaller L2P input pixel than the grid cell size, L3 data 
   product cell values are derived from an average of the L2P pixel which 
   completely overlap the product cell and which have a L2P quality record 
   `quality_level` value equal to the highest encountered within the cell, 
   to produce a single value. 
2. For input pixels that straddle the boundary between output grid cells, a  
   weighting function may be applied to the input values according to the 
   degree of coverage of the output grid cell and according to the SSES. 
3. Only the best quality original data within a grid cell should be averaged 
   to produce the resulting SST value, to preserve the homogeneity of the 
   SST quality (recommendation 1 above). In the case of averaging, the 
   number of contributors can be recorded as well as the sum of the SST 
   values and the sum of the square values of the SST. The SSES and 
   ancillary data (if needed, for instance if there may be more that one 
   SSES couple of values (bias and standard deviation) by quality level) 
   must be averaged accordingly: the `sses_bias` values are averaged 
   similarly as the SST values, the new `sses_standard_deviation` value is 
   the square root of the averaged squared values of the contributing 
   `sses_standard_deviations`. The averaging should account for the nature 
   of the original `l2P_flags`. 
4. In the case of a larger pixel than the L3 grid cell size, 2 approaches 
   can be adopted:
   - The value of the L2P pixel is allocated to the grid cell the closest to 
     the pixel centre.
   - The output grid cell takes the value of the L2P pixel in which its 
     centre lies. In this case the original latitudes and longitudes of the 
     pixel must be recorded, to be able to detect where the original L2P 
     pixel value has been duplicated.  

If the original grid resolution is larger than the output grid (e.g., 
microwave instruments), as illustrated in {numref}`regridding2`, the following 
practices are recommended by the GDS:

To illustrate the approach when the L3 output grid is under-sampled by the 
L2P data. Either Grid cell C is assigned the value of pixel p, Or grid cell 
A is assigned the value of pixel p and grid cell B is assigned the weighted 
average of p and q provided they both have quality flags with the same rating.

### Collating Data from the Same Sensor and Platform 

The collating procedure consists of gathering over a unique grid several orbits
or slots (in the case of a geostationary satellite) of the same sensor on the
same platform. This process is often known as “binning” the data. The collating
procedure merges data with different times of observation.

1. For situations in which the collation is to be done for data collected within
   the same day, two cases are met in practice: collation of consecutive orbits
   in the case of data collected from polar orbiting sensors, or the merging of
   consecutive slots in the case of geostationary satellites. In both cases
   there may be multiple candidates for a grid cell.
    1. To collate observations from overlapping orbits of the polar orbiting 
       sensors, the selection procedure should prioritize data first by 
       using the highest available quality data. If multiple observations share 
       the same highest quality, one of two approaches should be taken: 
       either the observation with the minimum satellite zenith angle should 
       be selected, or the observations should be averaged. If the minimum 
       satellite zenith angle approach is taken, the corresponding 
       `sses_bias` and `sses_standard_deviation` should be selected as well. 
       If the averaging approach is followed, the `sses_bias` and 
       `sses_standard_deviation` should be averaged similarly (note that the 
       new `sses_standard_deviation` value is the square root of the 
       averaged squared values of the contributing sses_standard_deviation 
       values). Also in the case of averaging, it is good practice to record 
       the number of observations being averaged, the sum of the SST values, 
       and the sum of the squared SST values. These values can be stored in 
       the `or_number_pixels`, `sum_sst`, and `sum_square_sst` variables 
       listed in Sections and 8 and 9.
    2. In the case of geostationary data, the selection procedure must 
       prioritize data showing the best quality level, and if equal, data 
       closest to the representative time (central time) of the L3 time 
       window. In the case of geostationary satellites, remapping is not a 
       preliminary step to the collating procedure.
2. If averaging over multiple days, only the best quality original data within a
   grid cell should be averaged to produce the resulting SST value, to preserve
   the homogeneity of the SST quality. The number of contributors can be
   recorded (`or_number_pixels`) as well as the sum of the SST values (
   `sum_sst`) and the sum of the square values of the SST (`sum_square_sst`).
   The SSES values should be averaged accordingly: the `sses_bias` values are
   averaged in the same manner as the SST values and the new 
   `sses_standard_deviation` value is the square root of the averaged squared
   values of the contributing `sses_standard_deviation` values. The averaging
   should preserve the nature of the original `l2P_flags`.

### SST Adjustments 

Most of individual sensors show regional biases resulting in limitations of the
applied algorithms. The objective of the adjustment procedure is to provide a
correction to these regional biases by comparison with a “reference sensor”,
supposedly free from such biases. A variety of sources can be adopted as
references in the adjustment procedure, ranging from AATSR or in situ
measurement to using a median of sensors approach. The adopted reference must be
recorded in the `adjusted_sea_surface_temperature` variable “reference”
attribute.

The adjustment procedure includes the following steps:
1.	application of the SSES,
2.	determination of the bias adjustment to the reference,
3.	evaluation of the error of the adjustment procedure 

```{note}
A skin to subskin conversion may be needed. In that case, please refer to
the STVAL recommendations. The type of the SST variables must be recorded in the
standard_names of the `sea_surface_temperature` and 
`adjusted_sea_surface_temperature` variables. The bias adjustment value at
pixel and the error of the adjustment procedure must be recorded in the
corresponding variables (mandatory).
```

(supercollating_best_practice)=
### Super-Collating Data from Multiple Sensors and Platforms

The building of a super-collated file is done by merging adjusted collated
L3 files from various sensors over the same grid and over the same time window.
There is one input candidate file (and hence one candidate observation) per
sensor. There may be multiple candidates for a given grid cell originating from
different sensors. To make the selection from among the candidates, a “decision
tree” or selection hierarchy should be established beforehand. This hierarchy
depends on the objective of the super-collation procedure, and may be quite
different for a moderate resolution (10km) super-collated over 24h aiming to
feed a foundation SST analysis and for a high resolution (2km) hourly subskin
SST super-collated aiming to feed a diurnal warming analysis, for example.
Because the hierarchy must be established based on the intended use of the
super-collated dataset that results, it is out of the scope of this document to
define any single hierarchy. However, the adopted hierarchy must be described in
the `comment` attribute of the `adjusted_sea_surface_temperature` variable.
In addition, it is mandatory to provide the source of the SST (`source_of_sst`)
at the grid cell level.
